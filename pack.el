;;; Commentary:

;; Provides some commands and functions to pack and unpack
;; archives in a simple way.

;; Commands to pack/unpack archive files can be defined by setting `pack-program-alist'
;; variable.

;; Use from Dired
;; --------------

;; To pack/unpack files from dired buffers, add following to your dired confiugration:

;; (define-key dired-mode-map "P" 'pack-dired-dwim))

;; This command creates an archive file from marked files, or unpack the file when
;; only one file is selected and that has an extension for archive.

;;; Code:

These can be omitted when pack/unpack cannot be done.
