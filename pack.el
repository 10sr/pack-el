;;; Commentary:

;; Provides some commands and functions to pack and unpack
;; archives in a simple way.

;; Commands to pack/unpack archive files can be defined by setting `pack-program-alist'
;; variable.

;; Use from Dired
;; --------------

;; To pack/unpack files from dired buffers, add following to your dired confiugration:

;; (define-key dired-mode-map "P" 'pack-dired-dwim))

;; This command creates an archive file from marked files, or unpack the file when
;; only one file is selected and that has an extension for archive.

;;; Code:

  (require 'simple))

(require 'cl-lib)

(declare-function dired-dwim-target-directory "dired-aux")

  "Alist of filename patterns, and command for pack and unpack.

Each element should look like (REGEXP . PLIST).
PLIST should be a plist that may have `:pack', `:pack-append' and `:unpack'
keys, whose values will be used as commands to pack, append files to existing
archive files, and unpack files respectively.
These can be omitted when pack/unpack cannot be done.

Each command should be in format like '(COMMAND ARGS...).
ARGS may contain symbol `archive' and `sources', which will be
replaced when executing these commands.
For backward compatibility, command also can be just a string, in which
case commands to execute will be generated as follows:

    COMMAND ARCHIVES [SOURCES...]


Alist is searched from the beginning.  So, for example, pattern for \".tar.gz\"
should be ahead of pattern for \".gz\""
